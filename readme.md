### Models:

2. **Contact:** Stores user-specific contacts with `owner`, `name`, and `phone_number`.
3. **SpamReport:** Tracks reported spam numbers with `reporter`, `phone_number`, and `reported_at`.

### Functionalities:

#### Registration and Profile:
- Users register with at least `name` and `phone_number`, optionally adding an `email` and `password`.
- Import of user's phone contacts into the app's database.
- Authentication: Users need to be logged in to access the API endpoints.

#### Spam Reporting:
- Users can mark a number as spam to help other users identify spammers via the global database.
  
#### Search:
- **Search by Name:**
  - Displays results with `name`, `phone_number`, and `spam_likelihood`.
  - Results prioritize names starting with the search query, followed by partial matches.
  
- **Search by Phone Number:**
  - If the number belongs to a registered user, only that result is shown.
  - Otherwise, all matches for that number are displayed (as multiple names can have the same phone number).

#### Display Details:
- Clicking on a search result shows all details along with the `spam_likelihood`.
- Email is displayed only if the user searching is in the personâ€™s contact list and the person is a registered user.
